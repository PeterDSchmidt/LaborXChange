Phase 1

Sign up for a job ; Jobs already signed up for should not appear

jobs signed up for should list job names

Close a job needs to allow final hours to be assigned to each helper, the job should be marked closed.

My Account should aggregate credits from all signed up and closed jobs - my jobs that are closed labor total.




Phase 2:

The ability to advertise your own services

Need a trust system so that no one gets mugged - Perhaps like Facebook or a rating system or a list of folks that have used an individual. It is important that this is not a barrier to entry.

Under Consideration:

Do we need to allow a job poster to add helpers that they choose not just those that have signed up?


Notes

I am not sure I need to have the helper sign up for hours. Perhaps only a sign up is sufficient then at close the hours are assigned. I could require a date be provided and a location, but perhaps that is to restrictive. Also might be a security issue if the location is listed prior to the sign up. ..

I have code commented out for a date picker as part of post a job. At some point I may want it.
